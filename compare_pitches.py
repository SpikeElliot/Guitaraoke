# TODO: Testing and improvement. Many notes aren't being accurately detected,
# there may be significant input latency offsetting all user notes by varying
# degree, and algorithm needs to be reworked in general to better capture user
# performance.
#
# Potential improvement is to consider note off events as well as notes on,
# to better gauge timing and how well the user is holding the notes.
#
# Due to overlapping recordings, duplicate notes are being counted every loop.
# A method of filtering duplicates from score calculations needs to be found.

    Take two dicts containing note event sequences for all possible MIDI pitches

    Parameters
    ----------
    user_pitches, song_pitches : dict
        A dictionary converted from a pandas DataFrame containing a list of note
        event times for each possible MIDI pitch predicted from an audio file.
